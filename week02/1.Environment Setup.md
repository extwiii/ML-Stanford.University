# Environment Setup

##Installing Octave on Mac OS X (10.10 Yosemite and 10.9 Mavericks)

Mac OS X has a feature called Gatekeeper that may only let you install applications from the Mac App Store. You may need to configure it to allow the Octave installer. Visit your System Preferences, click Security & Privacy, and check the setting to allow apps downloaded from Anywhere. You may need to enter your password to unlock the settings page.

2. Download the Octave 3.8.0 installer. The file is large so this may take some time.

3. Open the downloaded image, probably named GNU_Octave_3.8.0-6.dmg on your computer, and then open Octave-3.8.0-6.mpkg inside.

4. Follow the installer’s instructions. You may need to enter the administrator password for your computer.

5. After the installer completes, Octave should be installed on your computer. You can find Octave-cli in your Mac’s Applications, which is a text interface for Octave that you can use to complete Machine Learning’s programming assignments.

Octave also includes an experimental graphical interface which is called Octave-gui, also in your Mac’s Applications, but we recommend using Octave-cli because it’s more stable.

Note: If you use a package manager (like MacPorts or Homebrew), we recommend you follow the package manager installation instructions.
