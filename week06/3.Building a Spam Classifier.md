# Building a Spam Classifier

## Prioritizing what to work on: Spam classification example   

Building    a    spam    classifier    
How    to    spend    your    time    to    make    it    have    low    error?    
* Collect    lots    of    data    
E.g.    “honeypot”    project.    
* Develop     sophisticated     features     based     on     email     routing    
information    (from    email    header).    
* Develop     sophisticated     features     for     message     body,     e.g.     should    
“discount”    and    “discounts”    be    treated    as    the    same    word?    How    
about    “deal”    and    “Dealer”?    Features    about    punctuation?    
* Develop     sophisticated     algorithm     to     detect     misspellings     (e.g.    
m0rtgage,    med1cine,    w4tches.)    

## Error analysis 

Recommended approach    

* Start    with    a    simple    algorithm    that    you    can    implement    quickly.    
Implement    it    and    test    it    on    your    cross-valida3on    data.    

* Plot    learning    curves    to    decide    if    more    data,    more    features,    etc.    
are    likely    to    help.    

* Error    analysis:        Manually    examine    the    examples    (in    cross    
validation    set)    that    your    algorithm    made    errors    on.    See    if    you    
spot    any    systematic    trend    in    what    type    of    examples    it    is    
making    errors    on.
